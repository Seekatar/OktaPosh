SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides access to Okta Okta REST API and returns objects for easy use in
    PowerShell piplines. This is a work in progress and has support for a small,
    but growing list of Okta objects.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    To call any API, first set the token and baseUri with `Set-OktaOption`
    The default parameters are `$env:OKTA_API_TOKEN` and `$env:OKTA_BASE_URI`,
    which you can set in your $Profile file etc. to avoid setting it each time
    the module is loaded

EXAMPLES
    Set-OktaOption -ApiToken abc123 -BaseUri https://devcccis.oktapreview.com/
    Get-OktaAuthorizationServer # get all
